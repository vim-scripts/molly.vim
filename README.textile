h1. molly.vim

p. ZOMG! Very fast and sexy textmate-like command-t plugin. It also works for regular vim. By default it caches the filelist, so if you add a new file you have to call the `RefreshFileList` function.

h2. Dependencies

p. The only dependency `molly` needs is the unix `find` command.

h2. Getting Started

p. By default it uses `Leader Key + x` but you can change it to whatever you want.
